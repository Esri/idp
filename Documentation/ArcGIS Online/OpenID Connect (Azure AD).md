# OpenID Connect configuration using Azure AD

The configuration described below is for Azure public cloud only. Endpoints for sovereign Azure clouds (Azure Government, China Azure Cloud and Azure Germany) are separate.

## Title

1.	Sign up for an Azure account if you donâ€™t already have one by going to this site: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant
2.	 Go to https://portal.azure.com/ and sign in.
3.	Register an app by following the instructions at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app 
or by following the instructions below.
4.	Under Manage Azure Active Directory, click View.
Image-Welcome to Azure
5.	Click App registrations.
Image-App registrations
6.	Click New registration.
Image-New registration
7.	Specify the app name. You will provide a redirect URI later.

8.	Click Register. This gives you the application (client) ID. You will have to come back to add a redirect URI that will be generated when OpenID Connect is configured in ArcGIS Online.

12.	Specify the description and expiry information.
Image-Add a client secret
13.	Browse to the well-known URL. 

The well-known URL is of the form https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0, where tenant value can be common, organizations, consumers, and so on, detailed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc) depending on the type of account that is allowed to sign in to the app. 

In this case, use common, as the app will be used to allow both a personal Microsoft account and a work or school account from Azure AD, so the URL will look like this: https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
Go to https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration.

The response will contain various values that are used for configuring OpenID Connect for online organization.

In a separate tab, sign in using your ArcGIS Online organization for which you want to configure OpenID Connect using Administrator credentials.

14.	Click Organization > Settings > Security > Logins > OpenID Connect login > Set up OpenID Connect login.

15.	Configure OpenID Connect properties from the well-known URL and the application client ID and secret created above, and click Save.
