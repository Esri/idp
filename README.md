# IDP

## Purpose

This is a repository created to facilitate collaboration between users of ArcGIS, specifically to gather and share expertise for configuring SAML and OpenID Connect Identity Providers in conjunction with an ArcGIS deployment. Since there are numerous public, open-source, and proprietary products that implement SAML 2.0 and the OpenID Connect protocol, this repository is not meant to be a comprehensive resource.
