# IDP

## Purpose

This is a repository created to facilitate collaboration between users of ArcGIS, specifically to gather and share expertise for configuring SAML and OpenID Connect Identity Providers in conjunction with an ArcGIS deployment. Since there are numerous public, open-source, and proprietary products that implement SAML 2.0 and the OpenID Connect protocol, this repository is not meant to be a comprehensive resource. 

## Instructions

If you have issues configuring or using SAML\OpenID Connect logins with your Identity Provider, please contact [Esri Support](https://support.esri.com/).

If you would like to share your expertise by adding a new topic, or make updates to an existing topic, you're welcome to create an issue. Please include a draft of your proposed changes when submitting the issue. We will review all submittals for content and clarity, but welcome any style of writing. You can also send your contribution to our documentation team via this email alias: IDP_info@esri.com. 

## Info
This repo was released in the first quarter of 2021, with some initial Identity Provider documentation contributed by Esri.
